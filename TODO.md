### High priority:

- [ ] fix `nuscenes_render.py:34-36`. rotate is upset
- [ ] fix detection class issue where Box.detection name is too specific and we need a generic name
- [ ] Is it adding things to clusters successfully
- [ ] Why is Box not added being thrown by `cluster_devel.py`?
- [ ] Should so many RadiusBands have no gt assigned to them?

### Low priority:
[] Add a list of labels to the Cluster object
